# Naked-and-Heartless-plugin

Made for Minecraft 1.21-1.21.1 (i believe it can be used in newer versions too, just isn't tested though)

REQURIES SKRIPT, SKBEE, AND SKELLET IN ORDER TO WORK. WITHOUT THESE PLUGINS, IT WILL NOT WORK!

BELOW IS ALL THE COMMANDS THE PLUGIN HAS TO OFFER AND HOW TO USE THEM:

/Heartless:Master-Season <string> [<integer>] <string>:
  The first argument will ask if you want to start or end the season. The second argument is not needed for the start season, but is necessary for the end season. The second argument is a timer IN SECONDS. After inputting the number of seconds you want, the series will end. The last argument is just a confirm feature to ensure that you do want to run this command.

/Heartless:Master-Session <string>:
  The first and only argument will ask whether you want to start the session or end it session.

/Heartless:Master-Roll <string> [<string>] <integer> <string>:
  The first arugment will ask whether you want to roll hearts or challenges (as seen in the finale). The second argument is only for hearts and will ask whether you want it to be any amount of hearts ranging from 7-30, or a high amount of hearts. Ranging from 18-30. The third argument is a timer IN SECONDS. After inputting your wanted number of seconds, hearts/challenges will be rolled. The last argument is just a confirm feature to ensure that you do want to run this command.

/Heartless:Master-Roll-Late-Player <player> <string> [<string>] <integer> <string>:
  EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE REGULAR ONE, BUT ROLLS THE HEARTS/CHALLENGES JUST FOR ONE PLAYER. The second arugment will ask whether you want to roll hearts or challenges (as seen in the finale). The third argument is only for hearts and will ask whether you want it to be any amount of hearts ranging from 7-30, or a high amount of hearts. Ranging from 18-30. The forth argument is a timer IN SECONDS. After inputting your wanted number of seconds, hearts/challenges will be rolled. The last argument is just a confirm feature to ensure that you do want to run this command.
